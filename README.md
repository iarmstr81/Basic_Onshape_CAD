# Basic_Onshape_CAD

## Base
This piece was pretty easy to make. I had some trouble with trying to pattern the circles because it was patterning the whole part not just the circles but I figured out that I had to change it to just pattern the features.

## Mount
This was a super quick piece to make. Being able to sketch the square, the circles, and pattern the for circles in the corner all in one sketch was really nice.
